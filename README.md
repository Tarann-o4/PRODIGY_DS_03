# PRODIGY_DS_03
# Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction
This project builds a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is used as an example.

# Features
1. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and split data into training and testing sets.
2. Model Training: Build and train a decision tree classifier.
3. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
# Technologies Used
 1. Python
 2. Pandas
3. Numpy
4. Scikit-learn
5. Matplotlib
# Usage
1. Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.

2. Load Data: Replace the sample data with your dataset.

3. Run the Analysis: Execute the provided script to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
